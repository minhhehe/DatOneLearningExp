                    The Story...
                </h1>
                <p class="px-20">
                    Before mankind walked the earth, the world was inhabited largely by dragons, creatures with power to warp the very fabric of reality. Among them stood the Great Ones: Bahamut, Tiamat, Leviathan, Naga, and Orochi. Each of the Great One ruled a part of the world, cultivated life, and gave their blessings. 
                    <br>
                    An eternity later…
                    <br>
                    A giant meteor struck the earth, causing a great disturbance. The meteor revealed itself to be a great dragon, Vosakra, The Devourer, who sought to consume all life in the universe. Dragons are naturally benevolent creatures, so the existent of a mustache twirling evil dragon threw a wrench into the balance. The other Great Ones recognized the threat that Vosakra represented and sought to destroy him before it was too late. However, Vosakra’s power was far greater than that of the Great Ones, so they decided to fuse together into one and fought against the Dark One.
                    <br>
                    Their battle carried on for millennia, destroying almost all land and other lesser life forms. In the end, the Dark One was defeated, his spirit was sealed deep beneath the earth, while his titanic body fell into the ocean and became a giant bed full of life force and eventually became what is known today as the continent of Gaia. The Great Ones had expended too much of their energy after the battle, they separated and returned to their respective territory and entered a deep slumber.
                    <br>
                    The remaining energy during the separation of the Great Ones became Vera, the spirit of life. On the other hand, the remaining energy of Vosakra became Uma, the dark spirit. However, unlike Vera, whose form was supported by the Great Ones’ spirits, Uma’s form was very unstable and soon shattered into dust. The dust sipped into the land and corrupted the life force within. Vera used her power to stimulate the life force of the land to cultivate life, create new fauna and flora life forms. However, because the life force was partly corrupted by Uma, a portion of the life forms created by Vera were corrupted as well and became hollow fiends, seeking to consume other life forms. However, thanks to the abundant life force from the land, the dragon population quickly replenished, and they helped keep the hollow fiends in check.
                    <br>
                    Another eternity later… 
                    <br>
                    Among Vera’s creations, the first humans emerged. Vera quickly noticed that humans were unaffected by Uma’s corruption. She sensed a great potential in them, so she decided to become their god and guide them. Under her guidance, human civilizations sprung up and prospered across the continent. The golden age of mankind started and lasted for thousands of years.
                    <br>
                    However, at the height of their prosperity, mankind grew greedy and overly prideful, they started to wage war against each other. Vera became disappointed in her children, for they had forsaken her teachings, she abandoned mankind to retreat to a remote area known today as Dragon’s Rest to avoid having to witness the bloodshed. However, humans’ hubris knew no bound. Being unsatisfied with just killing each other, then sought to wage war against the dragons, for killing the divine beasts was the mark of ultimate superiority, the proof that they do not fear gods.
                    <br>
                    Countless dragons were killed, and the surviving dragons fled to the sea. Humans having nothing left to challenge turned to Vera, the very god that had uplifted them. They surrounded Dragon’s Rest, thinking it would be a swift victory. In the face of a betrayal most foul, Vera grew furious. Knowing she was no match for the traitors, she called on the power of the Great Ones. The Great Ones awakened from their slumber to answer her call. In tandem, they channeled a great amount of energy and blasted the entire continent. Most of the life forms were wiped out, all the human civilizations collapsed. Most of the human population were killed. With tremendous anger, pain, and sorrow, Vera sealed herself beneath the earth, and the Great Ones returned to their slumber. The human survivors gathered to rebuild their civilizations.
                    <br>
                    The blast by the Great Ones infused a massive amount of energy into the land, causing life on the continent to swiftly recover. However, the blast also stimulated the Uma’s energy within the earth, creating more hollow fiends, and this time, there were no dragons. Some of the Uma’s energy found its way to fuse itself with a pregnant woman, and sometime later, Uma was reborn as a human, albeit without memory of himself. 
                    <br>
                    The human survivors regretted their betrayal. They came together to create the Church of Axiom to revere Vera and the Great Ones, hoping to earn their forgiveness. However, in the crater blasted by the Great Ones appeared a ruin with the word Vosakra on its entrance, and a rumor that whoever explored all the secrets within the ruins would gain eternal life and their wish granted started circling around…
                    <br>
                    The story starts when a party of adventurers was formed in a town near the Ruins of Vosakra and their journey began…
